# Vehicle-Detector

Using technologies like OpenCV, Matlab computer vision toolbox a Gentle Adaboost Cascade was trained over HOG features of vehicles vehicle's back view and was presented as a product in the form of a mobile application. This project is a part of a feasibility study on the future of autonomous vehicles in Pakistan. Datasets used during the implementation include KITTI, GTI, and Mappellery. Whereas, the accuracy of the system is reported on LISA and TME Motorway datasets.
